# PRODIGY_ST_01# Task 1 – Write Test Cases for a Simple Calculator Application

# Objective
The goal of this task was to create detailed **test cases** for a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.  
The focus was on handling both **valid inputs** (positive numbers, negative numbers, decimals, BODMAS operations) and **invalid inputs** (non-numeric characters, division by zero).

# Test Case Structure
Each test case was documented in **Markdown format** and included the following elements:
- **Test Case ID**  
- **Test Description**  
- **Preconditions**  
- **Test Steps**  
- **Expected Results**

# Example Test Scenarios
1. **Valid Input Cases**
   - Add two positive integers (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8)  
   - Multiply a positive and a negative number (e.g., 6 × -2 = -12)  
   - Division with decimals (e.g., 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5)  
   - Complex operation following **BODMAS** (e.g., `2 + 3 × 4 = 14`)  

2. **Invalid Input Cases**
   - Division by zero → Expected result: Error message  
   - Input non-numeric characters → Expected result: Input validation error  
   - Empty input field → Expected result: Prompt for input  

# Tools Used
- Markdown for documentation  
- Calculator application (Demo Site provided by Prodigy InfoTech)  

# Outcome
- A complete **set of test cases** covering all possible valid and invalid input scenarios.  
- Structured documentation that ensures the calculator application works correctly and handles edge cases gracefully.
